# How to apply the changed files (Windows)

Follow these steps to run the updated project locally and verify the latest changes (e.g., the centered "Download CV" button in the Hero section), or to build for production.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended) and npm installed
- PowerShell or Command Prompt

## Run locally (development)
1. Open PowerShell.
2. Go to the project folder:
   cd F:\portfolio
3. Install dependencies (first time or after pulling changes):
   npm install
4. Start the dev server:
   npm start
5. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 if it doesn’t auto-open.

Changes to source files are hot-reloaded by default. If the dev server was already running, simply save the file and the browser will refresh automatically.

### Verify the update
- Navigate to the Home/Hero section.
- You should see the "Download CV" button centered below the main content and image, responsive on mobile.
- Clicking it should download the CV PDF.

## Build for production
1. From the project root:
   npm run build
2. The production build will be created in the build directory. Deploy the contents of build to your hosting of choice.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see dependency errors:
  - Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then run npm install again.
- If the page doesn’t reflect changes:
  - Do a hard refresh in the browser (Ctrl+F5), or clear cache.
  - Ensure the dev server is running without errors in the terminal.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
